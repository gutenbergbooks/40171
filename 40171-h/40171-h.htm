<h3>
<span>OUR FIFTH VOLUME.</span>
</h3>


<p>   Although We cannot commence our Fifth Volume, and the First of
   our enlarged Series, without some reference to so important an
   event in the history of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," our address shall be
   as "brief as the posey of a ring." We heartily and earnestly
   express our thanks to all our friends, whether Contributors or
   Readers, for the favour they have shown us, and the encouragement
   and support which have rendered the enlargement of our paper
   necessary. We entered upon our course with the support of many
   distinguished friends, whose varied acquirements stamped an
   immediate value on "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," and gave it a character
   which raised it to its present position among the periodicals of
   the country. The present number bears witness for us, that whilst
   we have retained our old friends, which we acknowledge with pride
   and thankfulness, we have added to the number many new ones. We
   have striven, and shall ever continue to strive, to unite them
   together into one goodly band, feeling assured that by that union
   we bring into the pages of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" the learning,
   kindliness, aptitude, and diversity of talent and subject, which
   are necessary to ensure its usefulness, and therefore its
   success. To all our Friends and Contributors, both old and new,
   we offer in their several degrees the tribute of our grateful
   thanks, and our heartiest wishes that we may pass together M<span class="smcap lowercase">ANY</span>

<span class="bla">Notes.</span>

<h3>
<span>STOPS, WHEN FIRST INTRODUCED.</span>
</h3>

<p>In casually looking into a little work entitled <i>The Tablet of Memory</i>,
I found an entry which informed me that "stops in literature were
introduced in 1520: the colon, 1580; semicolon, 1599."</p>

<p>Upon what authority the dates here quoted may have been supposed to
rest, I have no notion.</p>

<p>The comma, beyond question I believe, has been derived from the short
oblique line which, both in manuscripts and in early printed books, is
continually seen to divide portions of sentences.</p>

<p>The colon is of very old date, derived from the <span title="[Greek: kôlon]">&#954;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>
 of the Greeks, the part of a period. In
printing, we find it in the Mazarine Bible soon after 1450; and in the
block books, believed to be of still earlier date.</p>

<p>Herbert, in his edition of Ames's <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, p. 512.,
notices the first semicolon he had met with in an edition of Myles
Coverdale's New Testament, printed in 1538 by Richard Grafton. It was in
the Dedication, and, he says, a solitary instance in the book. The
only<a id="Page_2"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[02]</span> semicolon he subsequently met with, was in a book printed by
Thomas Marshe in 1568, on Chess. Ibid. p. 358.</p>

<p>Herbert says, both seem to have been used accidentally.</p>

<p>Puttenham, in his <i>Arte of English Poesie</i>, 4to., 1589, in his chapter
of "Cesure," says:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "The ancient reformers of language invented these names of
   pauses, one of lesse leasure than another, and such several
   intermissions of sound, to serve (besides easement to the breath)
   for a treble distinction of sentences or parts of speech, as they
   happened to be more or lesse perfect in sense. The shortest
   pause, or intermission, they called <i>comma</i>, as who would say a
   piece of a speech cut off. The second they called <i>colon</i>, not a
   piece, but as it were a member, for his larger length, because it
   occupied twice an much time as the comma. The third they called
   <i>periodus</i>, for a complement or full pause, and as a resting
   place and perfection of so much former speech as had been
   uttered, and from whence they needed not to passe any further,
   unless it were to renew more matter to enlarge the tale."</p>


<p>The "three pauses, comma, colon, and periode," with the interrogative
point, appear to have been all which were known to Puttenham.</p>

<p>Puttenham's <i>Arte of Poesie</i> has been already mentioned as printed in
1589. In the Countess of Pembroke's <i>Arcadia</i>, printed by W. Ponsonby in
the very next year, 1590, the semicolon may be seen in the first page.</p>

<p>A book printed at Edinburgh in 1594 has not the semicolon; the use of it
had not, apparently, arrived in Scotland.</p>

<p>That an earlier use of the semicolon had been made upon the Continent is
probable. It occurs in the <i>Sermone di Beato Leone Papa</i>, 4to., Flor.
1485, the last point in the book.</p>

<p>The interrogative point, or note of interrogation, probably derived from
the Greek, occurs frequently in Wilson's <i>Arte of Rhetorique</i>, 4to.,
1553.</p>

<p>Some reader of your "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," better informed than myself,
may possibly throw further light upon the English adoption of stops in
literature.</p>

<h3>
<span>PREACHING FROM TEXTS IN CORNWALL.</span>
</h3>

<p>Your correspondents have already pointed out the very early prevalence
of this usage, but the inquiry has brought to my recollection an
instance which incidentally affords some curious information respecting
the several languages formerly current in the western parts of this
island. It was lately published, among numerous other extracts, from the
registers of the see of Exeter, in the valuable <i>Monasticon Di&oelig;cesis
Exoniensis</i> of Dr. Oliver, pp. 11, 12.</p>

<p>In 1336, Grandison, then Bishop of Exeter, made a visitation of his
diocese. At the western extremity of it, is situate the deanery or
collegiate church of St. Burian, which has always claimed to be exempt
from episcopal visitation, or at least from ordinary jurisdiction. It is
probable that, on one occasion of this disputed exemption, the
parishioners of this remote district at the Land's End had given offence
to the Bishop or his functionaries.</p>

<p>In company with the Lords Mortimer, D'Awney, and Bloyhon (probably an
ancestor of your correspondent B<span class="smcap lowercase">LOWEN</span>), and a large staff of
archdeacons, chancellors, canons, chaplains, and familiars, the Bishop
visited the church of St. Burian, and obtained from the parishioners a
solemn promise of future obedience to his spiritual authority. The
promise was made by the greater parishioners in English and French, and
by the rest in Cornish, which the rector of St. Just (a parish which has
lately obtained some celebrity by the Gorham controversy) interpreted to
his lordship. Having absolved them, he then preached a long sermon on
the text, "<i>Eratis sicut oves errantes conversi ad pastorem episcopum
animarum vestrarum</i>," which the rector of St. Just there interpreted in
Cornish.</p>

<p>It is not stated in the record what language was used by the Bishop in
his sermon; but if he preached, as one of his successors, Bishop Lacy,
is known to have done, in the language of his text, the business of
explanation must have been rather troublesome. As he is said to have
"successively" preached this sermon there,&mdash;"<i>successivè ibidem publicè
prædicavit supra sumpto themate</i>,"&mdash;it is possible that he had to repeat
his sermon in more languages than one. It is at all events certain, that
<i>three</i> languages at least were employed, and that the Bishop did not
understand Cornish, nor the Cornish men the Bishop. The names of the
"major parishioners," that is, of the gentlemen of the district, are
appended to the document, and are all (except perhaps one) genuine
Cornish families, including the Boscawens and Vyvyans of the present
day. They gave in their adhesion to the Bishop in English and French,
and must therefore have understood one or both of those languages. Of
the Bishop's chaplains, only one has a Cornish name; and the interpreter
and rector of the adjacent parish of St. Just, Henry Marseley, was also
probably not a Cornubian.</p>

<p>I may mention that the penitent parishioners very prudently reserved the
king's rights. As the king claimed the deanery of St. Burian as a royal
peculiar exempt from ordinary jurisdiction, and eventually made good his
claim, it is plain that neither the promises of the parishioners nor the
polyglot sermon of the Bishop, could have had any lasting effect. The
patronage was soon after conferred on the Black Prince, and through him
transmitted to the present Duke of Cornwall, by whose spontaneous act
this obnoxious exemption from episcopal control was wholly and for
ever<a id="Page_3"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[03]</span> renounced within the last two years. The successor of
Grandison may now, therefore, visit the churches of the deanery,
excommunicate the ministers and parishioners, and interrogate
presentees, without let or hindrance; and, since the language of
Cornwall died with old Dolly Pentreath, his lordship will not require
the hermeneutic services either of the present or the <i>late incumbent</i>
of St. Just.</p>

<h3>
<span>ON THE EXPRESSION "RICHLY DESERVED."</span>
</h3>

<p>I was a few days ago induced to consider whence the common expression
"richly deserved" could be derived. It is used by Addison and his
contemporaries, but I have not been able to find it in writers of an
earlier period. Possibly the reading of some of your contributors may
supply instances of its occurrence which may prove more precisely its
origin and history.</p>

<p>The phrase, in its literal sense, is anomalous and unmeaning. We may
properly say that a reward or punishment has been "fully deserved" or,
by a common mode of exaggeration, we may say that a thing has been
"abundantly deserved:" but "richly deserved" seems a false figure of
speech, and presents to the mind an obvious incongruity of ideas. Dr.
Johnson cites a passage from Addison, in which chastisement is said to
have been "richly deserved," and says that it is used ironically to
signify "truly" or "abundantly."</p>

<p>Of the meaning of the expression&mdash;now by usage become trivial&mdash;there
can, of course, be no doubt; but how came so inappropriate a thought as
<i>wealth</i> to be applied to desert? The inaptitude of the expression
suggests the presumption that it is a corruption of some more correct
phrase; and I venture to throw out a conjecture, for confirmation or
refutation by the more extensive reading of some of your philological
contributors, that it is corrupted through the medium of oral
pronunciation from "righteously deserved."</p>

<p>In one of the prayers of the Litany, in our Book of Common Prayer, is
the expression, "Turn from us all those evils which we most righteously
have deserved." "Righteously" is itself a barbarous corruption of an
excellent English word, "rightwisely," which is used by Bishop Fisher
and other old writers. Our ancient kings were said to be "rightwise"
kings of England, and to hold their prerogatives and titles
"rightwisely;" and in the Liturgies of Edward VI. the word "rightwisely"
is found, instead of "righteously," in the prayer of the Litany
above-mentioned. Now "rightwisely deserved" is an expression as strictly
logical and correct, as "richly deserved" is the contrary; and as
"righteously" is clearly a corruption of "rightwisely," may not
"richly," when applied to desert, be corrupted immediately from
"righteously," and ultimately from "rightwisely?"</p>

<h3>
<span>THE CAXTON COFFER.</span>
</h3>

<p>If I were to print the explanation which follows without also producing
evidence that it had escaped the notice of those to whose works all
students in early English bibliography have recourse, it would seem like
advancing a claim to discovery on very slight grounds. I must therefore
quote Ames, Herbert, and Dibdin.</p>


<p class="blockquot">"<i>The history of Lombardy</i>, translated from the Latin [by William
   Caxton], is mentioned by Pitts."&mdash;J. A<span class="smcap lowercase">MES</span>, 1749.</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "I take this <i>History of Lombardy</i> to be no other than 'the
   gestis of the Lombardes and of Machomet wyth other cronycles,'
   added to the life of St. Pelagyen in the <i>Golden legend</i>, and
   printed separately for the use of the commonality [sic], who
   could not purchase so large a folio."&mdash;W. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ERBERT</span>, 1785; T. F.
   D<span class="smcap lowercase">IBDIN</span>, 1810.</p>

<p>Both Bale and Pits ascribe to Caxton the translation of a work entitled
<i>Historia Lumbardica</i>. Ames, as we have seen, states the fact with
regard to Pits, but had met with no such work; Herbert, by way of
explanation, assumes the existence of a publication of which no one had
before heard; and Dibdin, who had far superior means of information,
repeats the observations of Herbert without the addition of one word
expressive of assent or dissent. May we not infer their inability to
solve the problem?</p>

<p>The conjecture of Herbert is very plausible. One fact, however, is worth
a score of conjectures; and the fact, in this case, is that in the
earlier editions of the Latin legend the title is <i>Legenda sanctorum
sive historia Longobardica</i>. Jacques de Voragine, the author of the work
in question, was a Lombard by birth, and archbishop of Genoa. Now
<i>Lombardi</i> and <i>Longobardi</i> were synonymous terms&mdash;as we see in Du
Fresne; and so were their derivatives. With this explanation, it must be
admitted that the <i>Historia Lumbardica</i> of Bale and Pits is no other
than the <i>Golden legend</i>!</p>

 <p class="right">  B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>.</p>



<p>Since my last communication, I have ascertained that "Caxton," in
Cambridgeshire was also designated "Causton."</p>

<p>In the <i>Abbrev. Rot. Origin.</i>, 41 E. 3., Rot. 42., we have&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Cantabr. Joh&#275;s Freville dat viginti marcas [p=] li&#275;
   feoffandi Joh&#275;m de Carleton et Joh&#275;m de Selv&#773;le de man'io
   de <i>Causton</i>," &amp;c.</p>

<p>And in <i>Cal. Inq.</i>, p. m., 4 R. 2., No. 23., we have&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Elena uxor Joh&#275;s Frevill Chr&#773;. <i>Caxton</i> maner 3<span class="topnum">a</span>
   pars&mdash;Cantabr."</p>

<p>We have, then, in Cambridgeshire "Causton" and "Caxton" used
indifferently for the same manor. There need be no difficulty,
therefore, in identifying the name of "Caxton" with "Causton" manor in
Hadlow.</p>

<p>We have advanced, then, one step further in our investigation, and the
case at present stands thus: Caxton says of himself that he was born
in<a id="Page_4"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[04]</span> the Weald of Kent. Fuller, as cited by MR. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>, says,
"William Caxton was born in that town [sc. Caxton]."</p>

<p>In the Weald of Kent is a manor called Causton (to which we may now add)
alias Caxton, which manor was owned in the middle of the fourteenth
century by a family of the same name (from whom it had passed a century
later), and held of the honour of Clare, the lords of which honour, in
the fifteenth century, were that ducal and royal house, by which William
Caxton was warmly patronised.</p>

<p>From these data we will hope that some of your correspondents may deduce
materials for satisfactorily fixing the place of Caxton's birth. Is
there upon record any note of armorial bearings, or of any badge used by
Caxton? Should there be, and we find such to be at all connected with
the bearings of the lords of Causton, it will be additional evidence in
our favour.</p>

<p>In the body of St. Alphege Church, Canterbury, is the following
monumental inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "Pray for the sawlys of John Caxton and of Jone</p>
 <p>  And Isabel that to this church great good hath done</p>
     <p> In making new in the chancell</p>
      <p>Of Dexkys and Setys aswell</p>

</div>

<p>What relation (if any) was the above to the typographer? They must have
been co-existent, and the "Note" may perhaps be a step in the right
direction for arriving at the true "stock" of the <i>Caxton Coffer</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span>ADMONITION TO THE PARLIAMENT.</span>
</h3>

<p>I never had the good fortune to see a copy of the book called <i>An
Admonition to the Parliament</i>, but I find a full description of it in
Herbert's <i>Ames</i>, iii. 1631., under the date of 1572, from which I gather
that it had been printed four times anterior to that year. It was
written by two puritanical divines, Field and Wilcox, and contained such
an attack upon the bishops, that they did their utmost to suppress it;
but Whitgift, nevertheless, gave it additional notoriety by publishing
an answer to it, which came out originally in 1571, and was reprinted in
1572 and 1573 (Herbert's <i>Ames</i>, ii. 934.). I have not Strype at hand to
see what he says about the <i>Admonition</i>, and the reply to it; but some
time ago I met with a letter among the Lansdown MSS. (No. 27.) which
relates to the <i>Admonition</i>, and shows that Thomas Woodcock, a well
known stationer, had been confined in Newgate by the Bishop of London
(Aylmer) for selling it. It is dated 9th Dec. 1578, and is subscribed by
five of the most distinguished and respectable printers and publishers
of that day, soliciting Lord Burghley (to whom it is addressed) to
interfere on behalf of the poor prisoner. It runs precisely in the
following form:</p>

<p>"Our humble duties unto your good L. premised. May it please the same to
be advertised, that one Thomas Woodcock, an honest young man, and one of
our Company, hathe bin imprisoned in Newgate by the L. Bishopp of London
theis six dayes, for sellinge of certaine bookes called the <i>Admonition
to the Parliament</i>. Dyvers of the poore mans frendes have bin earnest
suitors unto the Bishopp of London for his libertie: his L. aunswere
unto them is, that he neither can nor will do any thinge without your L.
consent, signified by your letters or warrant. It may therfore please
your honor, in consideration of the premisses and our humble request,
either to direct your L. warrant for his enlargement, or els to signifie
your pleasure unto the L. Bishopp of London to take order herein
accordingly, the said poore man first puttinge in sufficient bond to
appeare at all tymes when he shalbe called, and readdy to aunswere to
any matters whatsoever shalbe objected against him. Thus prayinge,
accordinge to our duties, for your good L. long and prosperous health
with encrease of honor, we commyt the same for this tyme to the
protection of the Almightie. At London, 9<span class="topnum">o</span> Decemb. 1578.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Your L. most humble at Command the Mr. and Wardens with others
   of the Company of Stationers,</p>

 <p class="right1">    "R<span class="smcap lowercase">YCHARDE</span> T<span class="smcap lowercase">OTTYLL</span>,
     J<span class="smcap lowercase">OHN</span> H<span class="smcap lowercase">ARYSON</span>,
<br />    G<span class="smcap lowercase">EORGE</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">YSSHOP</span>,
  W<span class="smcap lowercase">ILLM</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">ERES</span>,
 <br />   J<span class="smcap lowercase">OHN</span> D<span class="smcap lowercase">AYE</span>."</p>

<p>From the above we may perhaps conclude, that an edition of the
<i>Admonition to Parliament</i> had been printed not long before the date of
Thomas Woodcock's imprisonment for selling it; but I do not find that
any historian or bibliographer mentions such an edition. Excepting in
the letter of the five stationers, Tottyll, Bysshop, Haryson, Seres, and
Daye, there seems to be no authority for connecting Woodcock with the
publication, and his confinement did not take place until Dec. 6, 1578;
whereas Neal, in his <i>History of the Puritans</i>, as cited by Herbert,
informs us that Field and Wilcox, on presenting the <i>Admonition</i> to the
House of Commons in 1572, were immediately committed to Newgate.</p>

<p>Unless there were two puritanical ministers of the name of Field, he,
who was imprisoned with Wilcox, was the John Field, who, I apprehend,
was the father of Nathaniel Field, the actor in Shakspeare's<a id="Page_5"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[05]</span> plays,
and the Theophilus Field, who (in spite of his father's hostility to the
church and bishops, and in spite of his brother's devotion to the
stage,) was afterwards Bishop of Llandaff from 1619 to 1627, Bishop of
St. David's from 1627 to 1635, and Bishop of Hereford from 1635 to 1636,
when he died.</p>

<h3>
<span>FOLK LORE.</span>
</h3>


<h4>
<span><i>New Year's Rain</i>&mdash;<i>Saxon Spell.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have just read a good-natured
notice<a id="notice1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in <i>The Athenæum</i> of December 6th, in which your contemporary
suggests that communications on the subject of <i>Folk Lore</i> should be
addressed to you. The perusal of it has reminded me of two Queries upon
the subject, which I had originally intended to address to the editor of
that paper, as they refer to articles which appeared in his own pages.
On his hint, however, I will transfer them to your columns; and avail
myself of the opportunity of thanking the editor of <i>The Athenæum</i> for
having for so long a period and so effectually directed the attention of
the readers of that influential journal to a subject of great interest
to many, and of considerable historical value. The first relates to a
song sung by the children in South Wales on New Year's morning, when
carrying a jug full of water newly drawn from the well. It is given in
<i>The Athenæum</i>, No. 1058., for the 5th Feb., 1848, and there several
references will be found to cognate superstitions. My object is to ask
if the song is known elsewhere; and if so, whether with any such
varieties of readings as would clear some of the obscurities of the
present version:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
     <p> "Here we bring new water</p>
       <p class="i2"> From the well so clear,</p>
    <p>  For to worship God with</p>
     <p class="i2"> This happy New Year.</p>
      <p>Sing levez dew, sing levez dew,</p>
      <p class="i2"> The water and the wine;</p>
  <p>    The seven bright gold wires</p>
        <p class="i2">And the bugles they do shine.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
      <p>"Sing reign of Fair Maid</p>
       <p class="i2"> With gold upon her toe,&mdash;</p>
      <p>Open you the West Door,</p>
       <p class="i2">And let the Old Year go.</p>
     <p> Sing reign of Fair Maid,</p>
       <p class="i2"> With gold upon her chin,</p>
    <p>  Open you the East Door,</p>
        <p class="i2">And let the New Year in."</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The second is from <i>The Athenæum's</i> very able review of Mr. Kemble's
<i>Saxons in England</i>,&mdash;a work of learning and genius not yet nearly so
well known as it deserves. The reviewer says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "In one of the Saxon spells, which Mr. Kemble has inserted in his
   appendix, we at once recognized a rhyme which we have heard an
   old woman in our childhood use&mdash;and in which many Saxon words,
   unintelligible to her, were probably retained."</p>

<p>If my communication should meet the eye of the gentleman who wrote this,
I hope he will let the readers of
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" become acquainted
with the rhyme in question. For it is obvious that among them will be
found many who agree with him that "a very curious and useful
compilation might be made of the various spells in use in different
parts of England, classed according to their localities,&mdash;more
especially if the collectors would give them verbatim," and who would
therefore be willing to assist towards its formation.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#notice1" class="label">[1]</a> We should not be doing justice either to our own feelings
or to the kindness and liberality of our able and most influential
contemporary, if we did not take this opportunity of acknowledging not
only his kindness upon the present occasion, but also the encouragement
which <i>The Athenæum</i> has taken every opportunity of
affording to
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>."&mdash;E<span class="smcap lowercase">D.</span> N. &amp; Q.</p>



<h4>
<span><i>Fishermen's superstitions.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A friend recently informed me that at
Preston Pans the two following superstitious observances exist among the
fishermen of that place. If, on their way to their boats, they meet a
pig, they at once turn back and defer their embarkation. The event is an
omen that bodes ill for their fishery.</p>

<p>It is a favourite custom to set sail on the Sunday for the fishing
grounds. A clergyman of the town is said to pray against their
sabbath-breaking; and to prevent any injury accruing from his prayers,
the fishermen make a small image of rags, and burn it on the top of
their chimneys.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE AUTHOR OF HUDIBRAS AT LUDLOW CASTLE.</span>
</h3>

<p>So little is known of Butler,&mdash;his life, as his biographers have given
it to us, is made up of so very few anecdotes and dates,&mdash;that I have
thought any Note which contained a fact about him, would be an
acceptable addition to "N. &amp; Q." (I shall value your space, you see, in
future contributions). The following entries are copied from Lord
Carbery's Account of the Expense incurred in making Ludlow Castle
habitable after Clarendon's "Great Rebellion" (query, Civil War); and
the entries are valuable as specifying the period of Butler's services
as steward of Ludlow Castle, and the nature of the services performed by
the great wit:&mdash;</p>

<h3>
<span>DR. FRANKLIN'S TRACT ON LIBERTY AND NECESSITY.</span>
</h3>

<p>In Dr. Franklin's <i>Autobiography</i>, he mentions as his first work a
pamphlet printed in London in 1725 on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure
and Pain. It was written by him when he was eighteen years of age, and
partly in answer to Wollaston's <i>Religion of Nature</i>. The object was to
prove, from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness, and
power, that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world; and that vice
and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing. He printed,
he says, only a hundred copies, of which he gave a few to his friends;
and afterwards disliking the piece, as conceiving it might have an ill
tendency, he burnt the rest except one copy. This tract, most curious as
the first publication of this extraordinary man, seems to have eluded
hitherto every search. In Jared Sparks's elaborate edition of Dr.
Franklin's Works in 10 vols., it is of course not to be found. In a note
(vol. viii., p. 405.), the editor observes, "No copy of this tract is
now known to be in existence." Nor do I find that any writer on the
subject of Franklin, or the history of metaphysics, or moral philosophy,
appears to have seen it. Sir Jas. Mackintosh was long in search of it,
but was compelled ultimately to give it up in despair.</p>

<p>I am happy to inform those who may take an interest in Dr. Franklin's
first performance&mdash;and what is there in literary history more attractive
than to compare the earliest works of great men with their maturer
efforts?&mdash;that I fortunately possess a copy of this tract. It is bound
up in a volume of tracts, and came from the library of the Rev. S.
Harper. The title is, "<i>A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity,
Pleasure and Pain, in a Letter to a Friend</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>'Whatever is, is in its causes just,</p>
     <p> Since all things are by fate; but purblind man</p>
      <p>Sees but a part o' th' chain, the nearest link,</p>
      <p>His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,</p>
      <p>That poises all above.'&mdash;D<span class="smcap lowercase">RYD</span>."</p>

</div>

<p>It is addressed to Mr. J(ames) R(alph), and commences: "Sir, I have
here, according to your request, given you my present thoughts on the
general state of things in the universe;" and concludes, "Truth will be
truth, though it sometimes proves mortifying and distasteful." The
pamphlet contains sixteen very closely printed pages in octavo; and the
author proceeds by laying down his propositions, and then enlarging upon
them, so as to form, in his opinion, a regular chain of consequences. It
displays, as might be anticipated, considerable acuteness, though the
reasonings, as he admits in his <i>Autobiography</i>, were such as to his
maturer intellect appeared inconclusive. He subsequently wrote another
pamphlet, in which he took the other side of the question; but it was
never published, and I suppose is not now in existence.</p>

<h3>
<span>EARLY FLEMISH ILLUSTRATIONS OF EARLY ENGLISH LITERATURE.</span>
</h3>

<p>The commencement of a new volume of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" affords a
favourable opportunity for "tapping" (to use an expressive phrase of
Horace Walpole's) a subject, on which it is reasonable to suppose much
light may be thrown by some of your learned correspondents. I allude to
the connection which formerly subsisted between the literature of
England, and that of the Low Countries. Fortunate, indeed, would it be
if any communication to "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" might be the means of
drawing some illustration from one qualified beyond all others to treat
every branch of this most interesting subject. Those of your readers who
had the pleasure of hearing the admirable speech of a distinguished
diplomatist at the Centenary Dinner of the Society of Antiquaries, will
probably understand to whom I refer.</p>

<p>Reserving for a future occasion some observations on the manner in which
our English antiquaries have hitherto overlooked the materials
illustrative of our popular literature, our popular superstitions, our
early drama, our legends, and our traditions, which may be had for the
gathering, from the popular literature, the popular superstitions, the
early drama, the legends and traditions of the Low Countries&mdash;those Low
Countries from which Chaucer married his wife&mdash;those Low Countries from
which Caxton brought us his printing-press, and its long train of
blessings&mdash;those Low Countries, in which, as I believe, and hope one day
to prove, Shakspeare himself added to his vast stores of knowledge&mdash;I
shall for the present content myself with one example, and<a id="Page_7"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[07]</span> that
shall be a seasonable one, namely, of the similarity between the old
Flemish carols, and those with which, at this happy season, the nights
were whilom blest here in Old England.</p>

<p>Hoffman von Fallersleben, in the second part of his <i>Horæ Belgicæ</i>, that
great storehouse of materials for illustrating the early literature of
the Netherlands (and which second part, by the bye, was separately
published under the title of <i>Holländische Volkslieder</i>), after showing
that the sacred songs of the Low Countries are, like our own, separable
into Christmas carols, Easter hymns, songs in praise of the Virgin, and
songs of Christian doctrine, proceeds to characterise the former in
terms in which one might well describe many of those which were formerly
most popular in our country. "The carols," he remarks, "are especially
deserving of our attention. In them is most clearly shown the child-like
religious spirit of the olden times, when men were not content merely to
relate in the simple ballad form the story of Our Saviour's birth as
recorded in Holy Scripture, but sought, by the introduction of little
touches drawn from social and country life, to make that story more
attractive and more instructive, and so to bring it home more directly
to the hearts of their pious hearers." How truly applicable these
remarks are to many of our own carols, must be obvious to all who know
Mr. Sandys' valuable <i>Collection</i>; and the following instances, which
Hoffman adduces in support of his views, will, I trust, satisfy your
readers that I am right in maintaining the great resemblance between the
carols of Old Flanders and those of Old England.</p>

<p>"Many of the descriptions in these carols," he remarks, "bear a strong
resemblance to some of the Bible pictures of the old masters;" and he
gives, as an instance, the following simple picture of the Infant Jesus
in the bath:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "'The mother she made the child a bath,</p>
     <p> How lovely then therein it sate;</p>
   <p>   The childling so platched with its hand</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#sprang2" class="label">[2]</a> The
 version is, of course, as nearly literal as possible.
</p>

<p>"But sometimes these religious poetical feelings impress themselves so
deeply in their subject, that the descriptions verge closely upon the
ludicrous:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"'Mary did not herself prepare</p>
    <p>  With cradle-clothes to her hand there,</p>
    <p>  In which her dear child to wind.</p>
     <p> Soon as Joseph this did find,</p>
      <p>His hosen from his legs he drew,</p>
    <p>  Which to this day at Aix they show,</p>
     <p> And with them those holy clothes did make</p>
    <p>  In which God first man's form did take.'</p>

</div>

<p>"It is true that we look upon these descriptions with modern eyes, not
taking into consideration that our manners and customs, that our general
views, in short, are not at all times in unison with those of the
fifteenth century. But even if we are always right in these and similar
cases, still we cannot deny that there often lies in these old poems
what we, notwithstanding we are in the possession of the most exquisite
skill, cannot at all reach,&mdash;an infinite <i>naïveté</i>, a touching
simplicity. Especially rich in this respect are the songs which describe
the flight of the Holy Family into Egypt:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "'Joseph he did leap and run,</p>
      <p>Until an ass's foal he won,</p>
      <p>Whereon he set the maiden mild,</p>
     <p> And with her that most blessed child.'</p>

</div>

<p>"The whole idyllic life which they led in that country is told to us in
a few unpretending traits:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p class="i2"> "'Joseph he led the ass,</p>
  <p class="i2"> The bridle held he;</p>
     <p class="i2"> What found they by the way,</p>
  <p class="i2"> But a date tree?</p>
    <p>  Oh! ass's foal thou must stand still,</p>
    <p>  To gather dates it is our will,</p>
     <p class="i2">  So weary are we.</p>
      <p>The date tree bowed to the earth,</p>
     <p class="i2"> To Mary's knee;</p>
    <p>  Mary would fill her lap</p>
      <p class="i2"> From the date tree.</p>
     <p> Joseph was an old man,</p>
       <p class="i2"> And wearied was he;</p>
     <p> Mary, let the date tree bide,</p>
      <p>We have yet forty miles to ride,</p>
     <p class="i2"> And late it will be.</p>
     <p> Let us pray this blessed child</p>
       <p class="i2"> Grant us mercie.'</p>

</div>

<p>"Nay, these simple songs even inform us how the Holy family laboured for
their subsistence in this 'strange countree:'</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "'Mary, that maiden dear,</p>
    <p class="i2">   Well could she spin;</p>
      <p>Joseph as a carpenter,</p>

      <p>When Joseph was grown old,</p>
      <p>That no longer work he could,</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Family Likenesses.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I believe that a likeness always exists in members
of the same family, though it may <i>not always</i> be seen, and, even then,
not by <i>everybody</i>. I have seen at times a striking likeness in a pretty
face to that of a plain one in the same family.</p>

<p>In one of the <i>Edinburgh Journals</i> (Chambers') a stranger is said to
have remarked the likeness<a id="Page_8"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[08]</span> to the portraits of Sir William Wallace
of a passer-by, and was then informed by his companion that he was a
<i>descendant</i>.</p>

<p>I am witness of a strong likeness in a young man, born in 1832, to the
portrait of his great-great-uncle, born in 1736,&mdash;which carries back the
inherited likeness to the latter's father, who was born in 1707, and
married 1730. It is no mere fancy of my own, but has been noticed by
several on seeing the portrait.</p>

<span><i>Inscriptions at Much Wenlock and on Statue of Queen Anne at Windsor.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;Carved in a beam over the town hall of Much Wenlock, in
Shropshire, stands (or perhaps stood, for the building was very old
thirty years since) the following curious verses:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "Hic locus odit, amat, punit, conservat, honorat,</p>
     <p> Nequitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos."</p>

</div>

<p>I am not aware if they have appeared previously in your publication; but
they are worthy of preservation, I think, if for nothing else, for the
oddity of linking one line with another.</p>

<p>There is also a couple of lines on the town hall, Windsor, underneath a
miserable statue of Queen Anne:</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p>  "Arte tuâ, sculptor, non est imitabilis Anna,</p>
     <p> Annæ vis similem sculpere? sculpe Deam."</p>

<p>The unintentional satire conveyed in the first line is very appropriate,
as the statue is a thing of wood, and forcibly reminds one of the
<i>charming</i> statue of George IV. formerly at King's Cross.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE AGE OF TREES.&mdash;THE GREAT ELM AT HAMPSTEAD.</span>
</h3>

<p>The question of the age of trees, introduced to your notice by your very
able correspondent L. (Vol. iv., p. 401.), and touched upon by several
others, is a subject of peculiar interest, and yet I scarcely know any
ancient memorials which have been so much neglected by antiquarian
inquirers. How seldom has any systematic attempt been made to collect
the existing historical evidence relating to them, and of the few weak
efforts which have been put forth in that direction, how insignificant
have been the results! Such evidence exists in a great variety of
quarters, and if your correspondents could be persuaded to adopt L.'s
suggestion, and take up the matter in a really serious spirit, the
nature of your publication, and the wide extent of your circulation,
render your pages singularly well adapted for doing really effective
service in a cause which is equally interesting to the naturalist and
the antiquary. What is wanted is, that antiquarian students should bring
forward the facts respecting historical trees which are to be found in
ancient evidences of all kinds, and that local knowledge should be
applied to the identification of such trees wherever it is possible. If
this were done&mdash;done, that is, thoroughly and carefully&mdash;I cannot doubt
that an antiquity would be satisfactorily established in reference to
many trees and clumps of trees still existing throughout the kingdom,
which it would now be thought supremely wild and fanciful even to
imagine. I would not go the length of anticipating that we might
establish the identity of some grove in which druidical mysteries have
been celebrated, or (to adopt the words of Sir Walter Scott) of some
"broad-headed, short-stemmed, wide-branched" monarchs of the forest,
"which had witnessed the march of the Roman soldiery;" I should almost
despair even of identifying the thorns on Ash Down (a place itself named
from some celebrated tree), around which the battle raged between Alfred
and the Danes: but every one at all acquainted with ancient documents
knows how frequently they contain allusions to celebrated trees; and it
is perfectly possible that trees which sheltered King John in his
continual wild, impulsive, Arab-like flights from place to place, or
under which the Edwards halted in their marches to Scotland or Wales,
may yet be pointed out. I have no doubt that Evelyn saw evidence that
the Tortworth Great Chestnut was a boundary tree in the days of King
Stephen; and if such evidence is not now forthcoming, I by no means
despair of its re-discovery, if any one will set himself seriously to
search for it. We learn in Pepys,<a id="Pepys3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that in his time, in the forest of
Dean, there were still standing the old "Vorbid" or "forbid" trees of
the time of Edward III.; that is (I presume), the trees which were left
standing as marks or boundaries when there was a great felling of timber
in the reign of Edward III. Perhaps some of your correspondents can tell
us whether there are any such trees known in the forest of Dean now.</p>


<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Pepys3" class="label">[3]</a> Pepys's
Diary, ii. 18.</p>


<p>The recurrence of the mention of celebrated trees in early charters, is
far more frequent than any one who has not examined the subject would
suppose. There was no kind of "mark" or "bound" more common amongst
ancient people, or more frequently mentioned in their written evidences,
than large or celebrated trees. Any one may satisfy himself upon this
point by a<a id="Page_9"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[09]</span> simple reference to Mr. Kemble's invaluable <i>Codex
Diplomaticus</i>. I have just taken down the third volume of that work,
and, dipping into it at random, at p. 448. I find the following, in the
enumeration of the bounds of some lands at Brokenborough, in Wilts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "From thence to the mark which is called the Apple-Thorn, and
   from the same apple-bearing tree, by the public street, to
   Woubourne, and along the same water by a straight course to
   Geresbourne, and along the same stream in a straight course to
   Ordwoldes wood, which is now called Bradene, and through the same
   wood for about three miles to the boundary mark, which is called
   holehoke" [Holy Oak].</p>

<p>Here are intimations which must have been recognizable in the spot for
centuries afterwards.</p>

<p>At p. 343. of the same volume, we read of "Kentwines Tree" at Shipford,
and "Adulfes Tree" and "Hysemannes Thorn" at Mickleton. At p. 336. is
mention of "the single thorn" by Ellenford, and the "Kolan Tree" and
"Huredes Tree," near the same place. At p. 328. we read of "the Hundred
Tree" at Winchendon. At p. 174. of "Dunemannes Tree" at Bladen.</p>

<p>In vol. v. at p. 297. we have a remarkable description of boundaries at
Blewbury, in Berkshire, in which we read, if I interpret correctly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "From Hawkthorn [now Hackthorn] to the Long Thorn on the Ikenild
   way; thence to the Third Thorn at Wirhangran; thence to the
   Fourth Thorn which stands forward on Wrangan Hill; thence to the
   Fifth Thorn; thence to the Olive Tree; thence west along the bye
   road to the Thorn"&mdash;and so forth.</p>

<p>In the same description we read of several "Treowstealls," which mean, I
suppose, clumps of trees, and amongst them of "Athelstanes Treowsteal."</p>

<p>In vol. vi. at p. 8. we read of "Frigedæges Tree," at Ginge, in
Berkshire; at p. 60., of "Wiggerdes Tree," at Plush, in Dorsetshire; and
innumerable other instances may be found throughout the book. These have
occurred to me on just opening the volumes here and there, and are
adduced merely to explain to persons unacquainted with the <i>Codex
Diplomaticus</i>, the nature of the information upon this subject which it
contains; and there are many other books from which similar facts may be
derived.</p>

<p>The examples I have given exhibit the various parts which conspicuous
trees were made to play in ancient times. The Holy Oak and Frigedæges
Tree had, no doubt, been consecrated to superstition; the Hundred Tree
marked a place for the general assembly of the people of a district; the
trees distinguished by the prefixed names of individuals, indicated that
they stood on the properties of private owners,&mdash;on lands, that is,
which the owners had "called after their own names." The memory of many
historical trees is probably preserved to the present day in the names
of the fields in which they stood. How many Mickle Thorn coppices, and
Broad Oak pastures, and Long Tree meadows, and Old Yew pieces are
scattered over the country. How many hundreds, and other larger
divisions of counties, are named after ancient trees. How many of the
old Saxon names of our towns and hamlets indicate that they grew up
around a well-known oak, or ash, or thorn, or yew; in like manner as, in
later periods, when strength rather than law was the ruler, the people
crowded together their hovels under the protective shadow of the castle
of some powerful chieftain, or within the privileged precincts of some
consecrated fane.</p>

<p>Having thus indicated, or rather enforced, a subject which I think well
deserves the attention of your correspondents all over the world, allow
me to conclude with a Query relating to a celebrated tree, of a
comparatively modern date, which once existed in the neighbourhood of
the metropolis.</p>

<p>T<span class="smcap lowercase">HE</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">REAT</span> E<span class="smcap lowercase">LM AT</span> H<span class="smcap lowercase">AMPSTEAD</span>.&mdash;Where did it stand? What was its ultimate
fate? When and how was it compelled to yield to the great leveller? It
is delineated in a very scarce engraving by Hollar, which bears the date
of 1653, and which is found on a poetical commemorative broadside,
printed in that year. This tree, although then in full leaf, or so
represented in Hollar's engraving, was entirely hollow. A staircase of
forty-two steps had been contrived within its stem, by means of which
visitors ascended to a turret erected on the top, which was capacious
enough to give seats to six persons, and to contain twenty persons in
the whole. The stem of the tree was twenty-eight feet in compass on the
ground, and the ascent to the turret was thirty-three feet. The tree
must have stood on some of the highest ground at Hampstead, for it is
said that six neighbouring counties could be seen from the top of it.
The Thames is mentioned as visible from it, with its shipping; and the
following lines indicate the wide expanse which it commanded. The lines
were written just at the time when Cromwell was about to assume the
Protectorate.</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Those stately structures where the court</p>
      <p>Had late their mansions, when our kings would sport;</p>
     <p> Of whom deprived they mourn, and, desolate,</p>
    <p>  Like widows, look on their forlorn estate:</p>
      <p>'Tis not smooth Richmond's streams, nor Acton's mill,</p>
    <p>  Nor Windsor Castle, nor yet Shooter's Hill,</p>
     <p> Nor groves, nor plains, which further off do stand,</p>
      <p>Like landscapes portray'd by some happy hand:</p>
     <p> But a swift view, which most delightful shows,</p>
     <p> And doth them all, and all at once, disclose."<a id="disclose4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

reference may be made to Wood's <i>Athenæ</i>, iii. 699. Bliss's ed.<a id="Page_10"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>Such was the entire command of the country which this tree enjoyed, that
it is said that</p>

     <p> "You must as far as unto Bordeaux go."</p>

<p>There are other things worth remembering in connexion with this wonder
of Hampstead: but I have occupied already more than enough of your
space, and will only express my hope that some one will tell us where
the Hampstead tree stood, and what was its fate; and what is known about
the Essex Broad Oak; and what also about the Bordeaux compeer of the
tree monarch of Hampstead.</p>

disease being so suddenly and so invariably fatal, where it appeared
unequivocally to attack the sufferer, might dispose the world to ascribe
the death to what surely may be termed foul play; but perhaps some of

treatment, or what could give rise to such an opinion in the public
mind.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Philip Twisden, Bishop of Raphoe.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Haydn's <i>Book of Dignities</i>, p.
475., there is the following note on the name of the prelate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Sir James Ware, or, more properly, the subsequent editors of his
   works, narrate some very extraordinary circumstances that
   rendered the close of the life of this prelate very remarkable
   and unfortunate; but we feel unwilling to transcribe them, though
   there seems to be no doubt of their truth."</p>

<p>As Sir James Ware died in 1666, and the latest edition of his work on
the Bishops of Ireland (by Walter Harris) was published in 1736, it is
impossible that either he, or his subsequent editors, could have
recorded anything of the last days of a prelate who died Nov. 2, 1752.</p>

<p>Mr. Haydn, however, speaks as if he had actually before him the
mysterious narrative which he has gone so far out of his way to allude
to, and which for some equally mysterious reason he was "unwilling to
transcribe," although he thought it necessary to call attention to it,
and to express his inclination to believe in its truth.</p>

<p>If this should meet his eye, would Mr. Haydn have the kindness to say
where he found the story in question, as it is certainly not in Ware? I
know of two stories, one of which is probably that to which Mr. Haydn
has called the attention of his readers; but I have never seen them
stated with such clearness, or on such authority, as would lead me to
the conclusion that "there seemed no doubt of their truth."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>"Sir Edward Seaward's Narrative," edited by Miss Jane Porter.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I am in
possession of a copy of the above work, presented to my father by the
late amiable authoress, Miss Porter. It is, as you are no doubt aware, a
journal of adventure in the Carribean Sea and its islands, between 1733
and 1749; but on the publication of the first edition its authenticity
was questioned, and a suggestion made by some of the critics that the
editor was also the author. This, Miss Porter assured me was not the
fact, and that the work is a genuine diary, placed in her hands for
publication by the family, still existing, of the original writer. The
name I think she intimated was not <i>Seaward</i>, but she expressed some
hesitation to detail the circumstances of its coming into her
possession. She makes, in a preface to the second edition, an
assurance<a id="Page_11"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[11]</span> to the same effect as to the genuineness of the
Narrative, and says the author died <i>at his seat in Gloucestershire in
the year 1774</i>.</p>

the hero of the Narrative really was?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Clerical Members of Parliament.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;In a note in p. 4. of <i>The Lexington
Papers</i>, recently published, mention is made of a Mr. Robert Sutton,
who, after having taken deacon's orders, and having accompanied his
relative, Lord Lexington, to Vienna, in the joint capacity of chaplain
and secretary, was, on his recall in 1697, appointed resident minister
at the Imperial Court; was subsequently sent as envoy extraordinary to
the Ottoman Porte; in 1720, succeeded Lord Stair as British minister at
Paris; in 1721, was elected M.P. for Notts; and in 1725, was created
Knight of the Bath. The editor adds this remark:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "It is well known that holy orders were not at that time
   considered any disqualification for civil employments, but I do
   not recollect any other instance of a clerical Knight of the
   Bath."</p>


<p>Do you, Mr. Editor, or any of your readers, recollect any other instance
since the Reformation, of a <i>clerical member of parliament</i>, before the

debates on the bill for excluding clergymen from Parliament?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Number of the Children of Israel.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Exod. xii. 37. it is stated that
the numbers of the children of Israel constituting the Exodus was
"600,000 men," "besides children." No specific mention is made of
<i>women</i>: it will be diminishing the difficulty if the 600,000 are
considered the aggregate of the adults of both sexes. It is said that
the time the Israelites remained in Egypt was 430 years (Ex. xii. 40.).
The number who were located in Egypt was seventy (Gen. xlvi. 27.). I
wish to ascertain from some competent statistician what, under the most
favourable circumstances, would be the increase of seventy people in 430
years? I am aware that Professor Lee, in his invaluable translation of
the Book of Job, is of opinion that 215 years is the time the Israelites
actually remained in Egypt; and the remainder must be considered the
previous time they were in Canaan. If the Professor's calculation be
adopted, the statistician could easily show the difference at 215 and
430 years.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Computatio Eccles. Anglic.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Bishop Burnet's "Hist. of the Reform.,"
vol. ii. of first folio edition, London, 1679, <i>Coll. of Records</i>, b.
ii. p. 100. No. XL. is "An instrument of the speech of the Archbishop of
Canterbury (Chicheley) made to the House of Commons about it," scilicet,
Statute of Provisors. It begins as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Die Veneris, penultimo mensis Januarii, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> <i>secundum cursum et
   computationem Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ</i> millesimo quadringentesimo
   <i>decimo septimo</i>, indictione sexta, pontificatus.... Martini Papæ
   quinti anno undecimo."</p>

<p>Now as Martin V. was chosen Pope by the Council of Constance, November
11, 1417, his eleventh year would extend over January, 1428, and the
sixth indiction answers to the same year, which would, however, be
styled 1427 in ecclesiastical documents till March 25. Can the
Computatio Eccles. Anglic. mean anything more than a reference to the
distinction between the ecclesiastical and historical times of
commencing the year? If it does not, decimo septimo must be an error for
vicesimo septimo, made in transferring the numeral letters into words.
Has this error been corrected in subsequent editions of Burnet?</p>

<p>&mdash;Will some of your intelligent readers deign
to enlighten a merely physical ignoramus as to the precise meaning
(always supposing there <i>be</i> a meaning) of the oft-recurring words
"objective" and "subjective" ("omjective" and "sumjective," according to
Mr. Carlyle) in the Highgate "talk", supposed by sundry transcendental
sages of our day to be the expression of an almost inspired wisdom. <i>Is</i>
this exoteric jargon <i>translateable</i> into intelligible English? or is it
not (as Chalmers called it, speaking <i>Scottice</i>) "all buff?" Most
assuredly he who really understands it (not <i>affects</i> to understand it)
need not, as Southey used to say, be afraid of cracking peach-stones.</p>

<p>&mdash;The master of a ship of war has the charge of
navigating her from port to port, under the direction of the captain;
and he is moreover charged to make what improvements he can in the
charts. Now the masters were sometimes rather slack in the latter
department, in which case they procured certificates from their captains
to the Navy Board, stating that they had seen nothing but what was
already in the general "Quarter Waggoner."<a id="Page_12"></a>

<h4>
<span><i>Sir Roger Wilcock.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your antiquarian readers favour me with
the armorial ensigns of Sir Roger Wilcock, knight, whose daughter and
heiress, Agnes, was wife to Sir Richard Turberville, of Coyty Castle, in
Glamorganshire, and by him mother of two sons, Sir Payn, afterwards Lord
of Coyty, and Wilcock Turberville, who by his wife Maud, heiress of
Tythegstone, in the same county, was ancestor of the Turbervilles of
that place, and of Penlline Castle.</p>

<p>The lineage of this ancient and knightly family of Turberville is not
given correctly in Burke's <i>Dictionary of the Landed Gentry</i> for the
year 1847. The marriage of Christopher Turberville of Penlline (sheriff
for Glamorgan in 1549 and 1568) with Agnes Gwyn,<a id="Gwyn5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> heiress of Ryderwen
in the county of Caermarthen, and widow of Henry Vaughan, Esq., is
altogether omitted in Burke, and for the correctness of which see Lewis
Dwnn's <i>Heraldic Visitation into Wales and its Marches</i>, vol. ii. (near
the commencement) title "Ryderwen;" and in vol. i. of the same work, p.
140., title "Ystradcorwg," Catherine, the issue of that marriage, and
one of the daughters and coheiresses of Christopher Turberville, is
mentioned as the wife of David Lloyd of that place, in the parish of
Llanllawddog, co. Caermarthen, sheriff in 1590 and 1601. In further
corroboration of this, we find that the Lloyds of Glanguelly and
Ystradcorwg, descendants of the said marriage, ever afterwards quartered
the arms of Turberville, viz. "chequy or and gu. a fesse ermine," with
their own paternal shield. It is not improbable that the marriage of
Christopher Turberville with the aforementioned Agnes, <i>kinswoman of the
Rices</i>, may have had some influence in allaying the deadly animosity
which had previously existed between the rival houses of Dynevor and
Penlline.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn5"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Gwyn5" class="label">[5]</a>According to Lewis Dwnn, this Agnes Gwyn was daughter and
coheiress (by Margaret his wife, daughter of Sir Rhys ab Thomas, K.G.)
of Henry ab John of Ryderwen, son and heir (by Mabli, or Eva, his wife,
daughter and coheiress of Henry ab Guilym, of Curt Henri and Llanlais,
in the vale of Llangathen, Caermarthenshire) of John ab Henry (otherwise
Penry), kinsman to the aforesaid Sir Rhys ab Thomas, and a branch of the
Penrys of Llanelli, derived from a common origin with the ancient and
noble house of Dynevor.</p>

<p>Again, in vol. iv. of Burke's <i>History of the Commoners</i> for the year
1838, Jenkyn Turberville of Tythegstone, fourth in descent from Wilcock
Turberville, is stated to have wedded Florence, daughter of Watkyn ab
Rasser Vaughan, and to have had issue by her two sons, Richard,<a id="Richard6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6." href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who
continued the line at Tythegstone, and Jenkyn, father of the said
Christopher, of Penlline Castle, Glamorgan. By reference to Lewis Dwnn's
work, edited by the late talented and much lamented antiquary, Sir
Samuel Rush Meyrick, article "Vaughan of Bretwardine, co. Hereford, and
Pembrey Court, Caermarthenshire," we find that Jenkyn Turberville
married Denis, daughter of Watkyn ab Sir Roger Vaughan, knight, with the
following remark in Welsh: "Ag ni bu dim plant o Derbil iddi ag wedi
guraig Morgan ab Jenkyn gur Tre Dineg;" that is to say, "She had no
children by Turberville, and she afterwards became the wife of Morgan ab
Jenkyn,"&mdash;I presume, of Tredegar, in Monmouthshire. Is it not,
therefore, likely that he married twice; that his first wife was Cecil
Herbert, and the mother of his two sons?</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn6"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Richard6" class="label">[6]</a> This gentleman had an ode addressed to him by the
celebrated Welsh bard, Lewis of Glyn Cothi.&mdash;Vide Burke's work.</p>

<p>A correct lineage of the Turbervilles, with the ensigns they were
entitled to quarter, down to Christopher Turberville's co-heiress
Catherine, the wife of David Lloyd, would greatly oblige.</p>

<p>Many persons living at the present time remember their being generally
worn in respectable, and occasionally in what may be called minor life.</p>

<p>The clergy did not wear them.</p>

<p>So general was their use in the early part of the reign of George III.,
that the Rev. William Cole, of Milton, in the account of his Journey to
France, in 1765, says he was taken for an English clergyman because he
did not wear them, and in consequence addressed "M. l'Abbé."</p>

<p class="blockquot">  [Why Roger claims the privilege to kiss Margery under the
   mistletoe at Christmas, appears to have baffled our antiquaries.
   Brand states, that this druidic plant never entered our sacred
   edifices but by mistake, and consequently assigns it a place in
   the kitchen, where, says he, "it was hung up in great state, with
   its white berries; and whatever female chanced to stand under it,
   the young man present either had a right, or claimed one, of
   saluting her, and of plucking off a berry at each kiss." Nares,
   however, makes it rather ominous for the fair sex not to be
   saluted under the famed <i>Viscum album</i>. He says, "The custom
   longest preserved was the handing up of a bush of mistletoe in
   the kitchen, or servants' hall, with the charm attached to it,
   that the maid who was not kissed under it at Christmas, would not
   be married in that year."]</p>

<p class="blockquot">   [The chapel, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, belonged originally
   to an ancient hospital, or lazar-house, under the patronage of
   the abbot and convent of Westminster. It was rebuilt in 1629, at
   the cost of the inhabitants, by a license from Dr. Laud, then
   Bishop of London, as a chapel of ease to St.
   Martin's-in-the-Fields, within the precincts of which parish it
   was situated; but the site was subsequently assigned to the
   parish of St. George, Hanover Square, and at present forms a part
   of that of Kensington. The Rev. J. Gamble was minister of this

<h3>
<span>SAINT IRENE AND THE ISLAND OF SANTORIN.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 475.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Your correspondent <span title="[Greek: S]">&#931;</span> asks for information about St.
Irene or St. Erini, from whom he thinks the Island of Santorin in the
Grecian Archipelago acquired its name; and in reply, you have referred
him to Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography</i>, for
particulars of the canonized Empress Irene.</p>

<p>But <span title="[Greek: S]">&#931;</span> is, I suspect, mistaken in supposing Santorin
to be indebted either to saint or empress for its present appellation;
although he errs in company with Tournefort and a succession of later
geographical etymologists, who in this instance have trusted too much to
their <i>ear</i> as an authority. Another correspondent in the same number,
F. W. S. (p. 470.), has directed attention to a peculiarity in the
formation of the modern names of places in Greece, the theory of which
will guide <span title="[Greek: S]">&#931;</span> to the real derivation of the word
Santorin. F. W. S. states truly that many of the recent names have been
constructed by prefixing the preposition <span title="[Greek: eis]">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span>
 to the ancient one; thus A<span class="smcap lowercase">THENS</span>, <span title="[Greek: eis tas
Athênas]">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#7944;&#952;&#8053;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span>,
 became <i>Satines</i>, and C<span class="smcap lowercase">OS</span>,
<span title="[Greek: eis tên Kôn]">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#922;&#8182;&#957;</span>, <i>Stanco</i>.
Lord Byron has explained this origin of the alteration in one of the
notes to <i>Childe Harold</i>, I think; but I apprehend that the barbarism is
to be charged less upon the modern Greeks themselves, than upon the
European races, Sclavonians, Normans, and Venetians, and later still the
Turks, who seized upon their country on the dismemberment of the Lower
Empire. The Greeks themselves no doubt continued to spell their proper
names correctly; but their invaders, ignorant of their orthography, and
even of their letters, were forced to write the names of places in
characters of their own, and guided solely by the sound. <i>Negropont</i>,
the modern name of Eub&oelig;a, is a notable instance of this. In the
desolation which followed the Roman conquest, Eub&oelig;a, as described by
Pausanias and Dion, had become almost deserted, and, on its partial
revival under the Eastern Empire, the old name of Eub&oelig;a was
abandoned, and the whole island took the name of Euripus, from a new
town built on the shore of that remarkable strait. This, pronounced by
the Greeks, Evripos, the Venetians, on their arrival in the thirteenth
century, first changed into Egripo and <i>Negripo</i>, and next into
Negro-<i>ponte</i>, after they had built a bridge across the Euripus. This
last name, the island retains to the present time. Another familiar
example is the modern name of Byzantium, <i>Stamboul</i>, by which both
Greeks and Turks now speak of Constantinople. The Romans called their
capital par excellence "the city" (in which, by the way, we ourselves
imitate them when speaking of London). Among the ancient Jews, in like
manner, to "go to the city," <span title="[Greek: hypagete eis tên polin]">&#8017;&#960;&#8049;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#949; &#949;&#7984;&#962;
 &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#960;&#8057;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span>, meant to go to Jerusalem
(Matt., xxvi. 18., xxviii. 11.; Mark, xiv. 13.; Luke, xxii. 10.; John,
iv. 18.; Acts, ix. 16.). The Greeks of the Lower Empire followed the
example in speaking of Constantinople; and the Turks, on their conquest
in the fifteenth century, adopting the provincialism, wrote
<span title="[Greek: eis tên polin]">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#960;&#8057;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span>,
 <i>Istampoli</i>, and thence followed
Istambol and Stamboul. The same theory will explain the modern word
Santorin, about which your correspondent <span title="[Greek: S]">&#931;</span> requests
information. The ancient name was <i>Thera</i>, and by this the island is
described both by Herodotus and Strabo, and later still by Pliny.
<i>Thera</i>, submitted to the usual process, became, from
<span title="[Greek: eis tên Thêran]">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#920;&#8053;&#961;&#945;&#957;</span>,
 <i>Stantheran</i>, <i>Santeran</i>, and finally
<i>Santorin</i>. In the latter form it almost invited a saintly pedigree, and
accordingly "Richard," a Jesuit, whose work I have seen, but cannot now
consult, wrote, about two centuries ago, his <i>Relation de l'Isle de St.
Erini</i>, in which, for the glory of the Church, he explains that the
island obtained its name, not from the Empress Irene, but from a Saint
Erine, whom he describes as the daughter of a Macedonian prefect, and
from whom he says it was called <span title="[Greek: Nêsos tês
Hagias Eirênês]">&#925;&#8134;&#963;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7945;&#947;&#8055;&#945;&#962;
 &#917;&#7984;&#961;&#8053;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span>. I incline, however, to
etymology rather than hagiology for the real derivation.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE OLD COUNTESS OF DESMOND&mdash;WHO WAS SHE? NO. II.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 305. 426.)</span>
</h3>

<p>My "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" coming to me monthly, I am as yet in ignorance
whether any of your numerous correspondents have answered my inquiry
(Vol. iv., p. 306.): "Whether the portraits of 'the old Countess of
Desmond,' at Knowle, Bedgebury, or Penshurst, correspond with my<a id="Page_15"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
description of that in the possession of the Knight of Kerry?" I have
since met a painter of eminence, who assures me that Horace Walpole's
criticism is correct, and that the portraits commonly known as those of
the Countess are really the likeness of "Rembrandt's mother." If they be
identified with that I have described, the idea that we possess a
"counterfeit presentment" of this ancient lady, must, I fear, be given
up as a delusion.</p>

<p>But the lady herself remains a "great fact," and a physiological
curiosity; and there is yet a subject for inquiry respecting her. We may
identify her on the herald's tree, if not on the painter's board or
canvas. <i>Who was she?</i> In attempting to discuss this question, I must
not take a merit which does not belong to me in any thing. I may say I
am but following out the original research of an accurate and
accomplished antiquary, Mr. Samthell of Cork, of whose curious <i>Olla
Podrida</i> (privately printed) I possess, by his favour, a copy, which
contains a paper on this subject originally read before "The Cork
Cuvierian Society." This paper, together with some MSS. notes of Sir
William Betham, Ulster king-at-arms, furnish my text-book; and I have
little more to do than correct some mistakes, which appear to me so
obvious, that I think they must arise from slips of the pen, or <i>slops</i>
of that most teasing confounder of dates and figures, <i>the
printer</i>,&mdash;who can so often, by merely dipping into a wrong cell of
type, set us wrong by a century or two in a calculation.</p>

<p>All authorities are agreed in fixing on "Margret O'Bryen, wife of James,
9th Earl of Desmond," as the long-lived individual in question. Sir
Walter Raleigh, by calling her "The old Countess of Desmond, of
<i>Inchiquin</i>," determines the fact of her being of the O'Bryen
race,&mdash;Inchiquin being the feudal territory of the O'Bryens. There was
more than one intermarriage between the Desmond earls and the O'Bryen
family; but none of them include all the conditions for identifying the
"old Countess," except that I have specified.</p>

<p>We now come to <i>dates</i>: and here it is that I have the presumption to
question the conclusions of the two eminent antiquaries on whose
researches I am remarking.</p>

<p>"James Fitzgerald, ninth Earl of Desmond, was murdered by John Montagh
Fitzgerald, of Clenglish, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1467, ætat 29," says one of my
authorities. "The old Countess bore the title only for a few months, for
she became dowager on the murder of her husband in 1467 (<i>not</i> 1487),"
adds my second authority. These are formidable <i>dicta</i>, coming from such
sources; and if I venture to question them, it is only under pressure of
such circumstances and authorities, as at least demand a hearing.</p>

<p>I think both these gentlemen confound the <i>murder</i> of James, the ninth
Earl of Desmond, with the <i>execution</i> of his father, Thomas, the eighth
Earl, who, according to all annals and authorities, was beheaded at
Drogheda in the year 1467. Of this fact there can be no question. Ware
gives it in his <i>Annals</i>, stating that "John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester,
called a parliament at Drogheda, and passed a certain enactment, in
virtue of which "the great Earl of Desmond was beheaded, 15th of
February, 1467." We find the very act itself (in the <i>Cotton MSS.
Titus</i>, B. xi. 373.) headed and running as follows:&mdash;"VII. Edw. Quarti"
(1467). "Pur diverses causes, horribles treisons et felonies prepensez,
et faitez per <i>Thomas</i> Count de Desmond, et Thomas Count de Kildar," &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>

<p>We now proceed with <i>Ware</i> to the date 1487, and he writes thus:&mdash;"On
the 7th of December, James Fitz-Thomas, a Geraldine, and Earl of
Desmond, who, for almost twenty-<i>eight</i> (?) years flourished in wealth
and power, was suddenly and cruelly murdered by his servants in his
house at Rathkeale in the county of Limerick." "This James dying without
issue, at least issue male, his brother Morrish succeeded him; by whom,
<i>John Mantagh</i>, the chief contriver of that murder, was soon after taken
and slain." Here is a distinct statement from an annalist which may be
contradicted by facts, but cannot be misunderstood as to meaning.</p>

<p>The more I look at Mr. Samthell's account, the more I am disposed to
consider the date he gives as a slip of the pen, or the result of that
kind of confusion into which the most accurate mind will sometimes fall,
from <i>too long</i> and <i>intense</i> consideration of the same point. I say
this, because his own statements furnish at every step matter to confute
his own conclusions: thus, he says, "Supposing the old Countess to have
been <i>eighteen</i> at her husband's death (and the Irish marry young), she
would have been 140 years old in 1589." This calculation plainly
<i>assumes</i> the death to have taken place in 1467; but in a passage
further on he says, "It will be remembered, that Thomas, <i>eighth</i> Earl
of Desmond, <i>father to Margret O'Bryen's husband</i>, was Lord Deputy of
Ireland for the Duke Clarence, brother to Edw. IV., from 1462 to 1467!"
And again, giving some brief notices of the earls from "A Pedigree of
Sir William Betham's," he sets down, "8th earl, Thomas, beheaded <span class="smaller">A.D.</span>
1467; 9th earl, James (son of Thomas), murdered <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1467;"&mdash;overlooking
the fact, which would have been in itself <i>memorable</i>, that he makes the
beheading of the father, and the murder of the son, to have taken place
in the same year! Although I cannot ascertain whence Mr. Pelham took the
dates which he has given in his print, I have no hesitation in adopting
them, as agreeing best with all the probable circumstances of the case;
he places Margret O'Bryen's birth in 1464, her death <i>somewhere</i> from
1620 to 1626; this would sufficiently tally with the<a id="Page_16"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[16]</span> opinion, that
she was left a young widow at her husband's death in 1487, and agree
with Sir Walter Raleigh's statement, that she "was living in 1589," and
"<i>many years afterwards</i>." Lord Bacon's express words are, "<i>Certainly
they report that within these few years</i> the Countess of Desmond lived
to an hundred and forty years of age." These words occur in his <i>History
of Life and Death</i>, published in 1623, and add to the probability that
the old lady was either lately dead, or that possibly, in the little
intercourse between London and remote parts of the empire at that
period, she might be <i>even then</i> alive, without his knowledge.</p>

<p>I submit these speculations to correction; and in venturing to dispute
the conclusions of the authorities I have named, I feel myself somewhat
in the position of a dwarf, who, climbing on the shoulder of a giant,
should assume the airs of a tall man; but for the encouragement and
assistance of the gentlemen I have named, I should probably never have
known how even to state a genealogical or antiquarian question. I shall
conclude by committing myself to your printer's mercy, trusting that he
will be too magnanimous to take notice of my remarks on the "slip-slop"
printing of figures, which will sometimes occur in the best offices; if
he should misprint my figures, all my facts will fall to the ground.</p>

<p>In the Birch Collections at the British Museum there is a transcript of
a Table-Book of Robert Sydney, second Earl of Leicester, made by Birch
(<i>Add. MSS. 4161.</i>), the following extract from which, P. C. S. S.
believes will not be unacceptable to the readers of
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>:"</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "The olde Countess of Desmond was a marryed woman in Edward IV.'s
   time, of England, and lived till towards the end of Queen
   Elizabeth, soe as she needes must be 140 yeares old: shee had a
   newe sett of teeth not long before her death, and might have
   lived much longer, had shee not mett with a kind of violent
   death; for she must needes climb a nutt-tree to gather nutts, soe
   falling downe, shee hurt her thigh, which brought a fever, and
   that fever brought death. This my cosen Walter Fitzwilliam told
   me. This olde lady, Mr. Harnet told me, came to petition the
   Queen, and landing at Bristol, shee came on foote to London,
   being then soe olde that her doughter was decrepit, and not able
   to come with her, but was brought in a little cart, their poverty
   not allowing them better provision of meanes. As I remember, Sir
   Walter Rowleigh, in some part of his <i>History</i>, speakes of her,
   and says that he saw her in England, anno 1589. Her death was as
   strange and remarkable as her long life was,&mdash;having seene the
   deaths of so many descended from her; and both her own and her
   husband's house ruined in the rebellion and wars."</p>

<h3>
<span>COLLAR OF SS.<br />
(Vol. ii., p. 140.; Vol. iv., pp. 147. 236. 456.)</span>
</h3>

<p>In my communication to you in August, 1850, and inserted as above, I
stated that I was uncertain whether the collar of SS. was worn by the
Chief Baron of the Exchequer previously to the reign of George I., as I
had no portrait of that functionary of an earlier date.</p>

<p>I have since found, and I ought to have sent you the fact before, that
the Chief Baron, as well as the two Chief Justices, was decorated with
this collar in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In the church of St.
Stephen's, near Canterbury, is the monument of Sir Roger Manwood, who
died Lord Chief Baron on December 14, 1592, on which his bust appears in
full judicial robes (colored proper), over which he wears the collar in
its modern form.</p>

 <p class="right">   E<span class="smcap lowercase">DWARD</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">OSS</span>.</p>

<p>Was the collar of SS. worn by persons under a vow to make a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land, or to join a crusade, the S. being the initial letter
of Sépulcre, or SS. for Saint Sépulcre? The appearance of the
above-mentioned collar on the effigy of a person in the habit of a
pilgrim in the church of Ashby-de-la-Zouch (see "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>,"
Vol. iv., p. 345.), so strongly confirms the idea, that I beg leave to
offer it to the consideration of any readers of the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"
who may be interested in the question.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Tregonwell Frampton</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 474.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Noble mentions two
engravings of this gentleman in the <i>Continuation to Granger</i>, vol. ii.
p. 387., from a portrait by J. Wootton; the oldest, by J. Faber,
describes him as "Royal Studkeeper at Newmarket;" the other, dated 1791,
by J. Jones, styles him "the Father of the Turf;" and his death in 1728,
æt. eighty-six, is recorded on a monument in the parish church of All
Saints, Newmarket, as well as the circumstance of his having been keeper
of the running horses to King William III. and his three royal
successors.</p>

<p>Frampton, according to Noble, who quotes from some other author, was a
thorough good groom only, yet would have made a good minister of state
had he been trained to it, and no one in his day was so well acquainted
with the pedigrees of race-horses. I am not aware of there being any
reference to Tregonwell Frampton in the <i>Rambler</i>, but he has frequently
been denounced as the author of an unparalleled act of barbarity to a
race-horse, which is detailed in the <i>Adventurer</i>, No. 37., as
delicately as such a subject would permit. In justice to the accused I
must say, that I always considered the story as physically impossible;
and had this not been the case, it cannot be credited<a id="Page_17"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[17]</span> that the
author of so great an enormity could have been continued in the service
of the Crown. Still the essayist, who wrote nearly a century ago, thus
closes his recital:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">    "When I had heard this horrid narrative, <i>which indeed I
   remembered to be true</i>, I turned about in honest confusion, and
   blushed that I was a man."</p>

<p>I hope some of your correspondents may be able to clear Frampton from
the dreadful imputation.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Longueville MSS.</i> </span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 449.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This collection (of 187
volumes) is better known by the name of the <i>Yelverton MSS.</i>, from
having belonged to Sir Christopher Yelverton, Bart., who died in 1654,
and whose son Henry (by Susan, Baroness Grey of Ruthin) was created
Viscount Longueville in 1690. From him (who died in 1704) these MSS.
descended to his grandson, Henry, third Earl of Sussex, who deceased in
1799 without male issue. In April, 1781, this collection of MSS. (then
stated to consist of 179 volumes, and eight wanting to complete the
series) was offered for purchase to the trustees of the British Museum
for 3000 guineas, and declined. The loss of these eight volumes is
accounted for by a note of Gough (written in 1788), in Nichols'
<i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, vol. iii. p. 622., by which it appears, that in
1784 the collection was submitted to sale by public auction; but "<i>after
the sale of a few lots</i>, the sale was stopped." Gough adds, "They were
all given by Lord Sussex to Lord Calthorpe, whose mother was of that
family [Barbara, eldest daughter of Henry, Viscount Longueville], and at
his death had not been opened, nor perhaps since." These MSS. are now, I
believe, in the possession of the present Lord Calthorpe.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Cooper's Miniature of Cromwell</i></span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 368.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The miniature of
Oliver Cromwell, inquired for by
 L<span class="smcap lowercase">ORD</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">RAYBROOKE</span>, I think was shown to
me at a party in London, about five or six years since, by Mr.
Macgregor, M.P.,&mdash;at least I suppose it to be the same, though I had
forgotten the name of the painter; but Mr. Macgregor prized it very
highly, as being the only original miniature of Cromwell, and I think he
said it was the one that had belonged to Sir Joshua Reynolds. This
slight recollection of having seen it, is almost too vague to be worth
alluding to, but as no one appears to have replied to the inquiry, it
may lead to connecting the true history to the miniature, and thereby
enhance its value.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Pope and Flatman</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 505.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your readers will probably be
tired of the subject, still M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">REEN</span> may like to know that the
resembling passages in the two copies in question, are quoted with the
names of the authors in the sixty-third number of <i>The Adventurer</i>,
dated <i>June 12, 1753</i>, and Pope is directly accused of <i>having copied
from one of the vilest Pindaric writers, in the time of Charles II.</i></p>

<p>The same paper, and a subsequent one, No. 95., contain some excellent
remarks upon the allegation of resemblance between authors, and the
charge of plagiarism so frequently raised upon it, but not always to be
allowed with equal readiness.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me express a wish, that the essays which I have
pointed out could be perused by some of your correspondents, because I
am convinced that we should in future have fewer discussions on parallel
passages, which seldom possess much real interest, and frequently have a
tendency to injure the fair fame of our most gifted writers, by calling
in question their literary honesty without establishing the charge
brought against them.</p>

<span><i>Voltaire</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 457.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent J. R. is quite
correct as to the name "Voltaire" being an anagram of "Arouet L. J." The
fact, however, was first made public by M. Lepan in the <i>Détails
Préliminaires sur les Biographies de Voltaire</i>, prefixed to his <i>Vie
Politique, Littéraire et Morale de Voltaire</i>, many years before the
communications to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> and the <i>Dublin Review</i>,
referred to by your correspondent.</p>

<p>Your correspondent states that "Voltaire <i>was a little partial</i> to his
paternal name,"<a id="name7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7." href="#fn7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>  and oddly enough gives two extracts from his letters
to L'Abbé Moussinot, which prove the very contrary. Those extracts are
<i>also</i> to be found in M. Lepan's work, who has adduced them to show "son
<i>mépris</i> pour son nom de famille." <i>Vie de Voltaire</i>, p. 11. edit. 1817.</p>

Horse, in a 4to. collection of ancient Kymric poetry, published at
Amwythig, in 1773, by Rhys Jones. It is entitled <i>Gorchestion Beirdd

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>When Mr. Wilkin, in the year 1836, gave to the world an edition of the
works of his illustrious townsman, Sir Thomas Browne, the critics were
unanimous in their praise both of the undertaking and of the manner in
which the editor had executed his task. It was felt that the writings of
so great a man&mdash;of one on whose style Johnson is supposed to have formed
his own&mdash;and whose <i>Religio Medici</i> he eulogized for "the novelty of the
paradoxes, the dignity of sentiment, the quick succession of images, the
multitude of abstruse allusions, the subtlety of disquisition, and the
strength of language" to be found in it, ought to be made better known;
and Mr. Wilkin's endeavour to make them so was lauded as it deserved.
That attempt, however, was but feeble compared with the one now making
by Mr. Bohn, who has undertaken to reproduce Mr. Wilkin's excellent
edition of <i>The Works of Sir Thomas Browne</i> in his <i>Antiquarian
Library</i>. The first volume, containing Four Books of his <i>Enquiries into
Common and Vulgar Errors</i>, has been issued; and, we need scarcely add,
forms one which is not surpassed for learning, interest, or
instructions, by any other in the very cheap and useful series to which
it belongs.</p>

<p>One of the most popular branches of botanical study at the present day
is that of our British Ferns, from the very obvious causes&mdash;that they
are objects of exquisite elegance&mdash;not very numerous, nor difficult to
be procured&mdash;and, lastly, which may well account for their popularity
with the dwellers in towns, who yet love to "babble of green fields" and
be reminded of them&mdash;they are for the most part easily cultivated, and
of all others are perhaps best adapted to parlour or window culture. Who
then can doubt that, in preparing <i>A Popular History of the British
Ferns and the allied Plants, comprising the Club-Mosses, Pepperworts,
and Horse Tails</i> (with its fifty admirable coloured representations of
the most interesting species), Mr. Moore has done good service to the
numerous fern growers already existing, and much to promote the further
study of this highly interesting division of the vegetable world.
Messrs. Reeve and Benham deserve great credit for the way in which they
have seconded Mr. Moore's efforts, by the admirable manner in which the
book has been got up.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOKS</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECEIVED</span>.&mdash;<i>The Traveller's Library</i>, Part 13., containing two

Writings of Addison, and on Horace Walpole</i>.&mdash;<i>Travels in Tartary,
Thibet, and China during the Years 1844, '45, and '46</i>, by M. Huc:
<i>translated from the French</i>, by W. Hazlitt. Vol. 1.&mdash;<i>Pictures of
Travels in the South of France</i>, by Alexandre Dumas. These are two new
volumes of the <i>National Illustrated Library</i>, and very interesting
ones. The value of M. Huc's Travels in China may be judged of from the
fact, that Sir John Davis having received some notes of them, considered
them so interesting that he thought it right to embody them in a
despatch to Lord Palmerston.&mdash;<i>The Mother's Legacie to her Unborne
Childe.</i> By Elizabeth Joceline. <i>Reprinted from the Edition of 1625,
with Biographical and Historical Introduction.</i> We may content ourselves
with acknowledging the receipt of this handsome reprint, by the Messrs.
Blackwood, as it forms the subject of a communication from the
correspondent who first drew attention to this interesting volume in N.
&amp; Q., which we hope to print next week.&mdash;<i>Archæologia Cambrensis for
January, 1852.</i> This is an excellent number; and if this record of the
antiquities of Wales and its Marches does not meet with the support not
only of the antiquaries, but also of the gentry of the principality, it
will be a national reproach to them.</p>

<p>This work, containing the earliest history of Greece drawn from original
sources, treats of the colonization of that country from North-Western
India, of the Budhistic Propaganda, the Tartarian Mission, and the wars
of the Grand Lama in Hellas&mdash;corresponding Maps of India and Greece
exhibit the exact parent tribes and districts of the latter country, in
Cashmir, Thibet, Tartary, Afghanistan, and North-Western India. This
geographical basis leads the way to a thorough revision of early
Hellenic history, whereby the Cyclopes, Autochthous, Erectheus, Cecrops,
Corybantes, Cabeiri, and a long list of Mythologic agents, are at once
placed in the category of history.</p>

<p>This work, equally adapted to the general reader and the scholar,
corroborates in the most interesting way, the scriptural accounts of the
Hebrew settlements of the Children of Israel in Palestine, and
demonstrates their wars with the Tartar and Rajpoot tribes of that
country.</p>
